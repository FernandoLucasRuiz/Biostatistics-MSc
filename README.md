# Biostatistics 

This repository contains the coursework and projects for the "Biostatistics" module, which is part of the Master's in Bioinformatics program at the University of Murcia. The course provides a foundation in statistical analysis techniques tailored for experimental and multivariate data, crucial for modern bioinformatics.

## Course Overview

The Biostatistics course covers a broad range of topics essential for the analysis of bioinformatics data, focusing on experimental design, multivariate analysis, statistical comparison and prediction models, and Bayesian inference. 

### Key Topics

1. **Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data**
   - Introduction to statistical concepts and techniques for analyzing experimental data in bioinformatics.
2. **Statistical Analysis of Multivariate Data**
   - Techniques and methods for handling and analyzing multivariate datasets, important for large-scale bioinformatics studies.
3. **Analysis of Statistical Comparison and Prediction Models**
   - Statistical methods for comparing groups and predicting outcomes using statistical models.
4. **Bayesian Inference**
   - Principles of Bayesian statistics and their application in bioinformatics for making probabilistic inferences from data.
